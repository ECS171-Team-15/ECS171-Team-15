## Repository Guidelines

**Forking and Pull Requests**

Changes to the repository are not made directly. Instead:

1. Create a fork of this repository. This is a copy of the repository that you may edit yourself!
2. Make any changes to your fork.
3. To apply your changes, submit a pull request to this repository. Before submitting a pull request, make sure your fork is updated by "pulling" the latest changes from this repository. This is to avoid merge conflicts where the repository has commits that your fork does not. 
5. Wait for the team leader to approve and merge your changes. Merging means that your changes are made to the codebase. If they were not approved, the team leader will explain why in the pull request and you should modify your changes accordingly.

**Commits**

Remember to make your commit messages meaningful. This will help others understand the changes you made better!

By convention, your commit messages should be in the present tense. For example, the commit message:

*Implemented gradient descent*

should instead be:

*Implement gradient descent*
